- 👋 Hi, I’m @Epigy
- 👀 I’m interested in ... to much to list here. lol Started learning to code this summer (2X22) & keep hearing about this github place, so I'm checking it out.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... All about Arduino!  And JavaScript.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nada at the moment.  Still newb enought to just be observing.  lol
- 📫 How to reach me ...  Through an ancient incantation using a cauldron and a spoon!!  ...and cooler/more mysterious stuff.  Mysterious...  Or if there is a message feature on here.  Dunno why there wouldn't be, but I haven't looked yet.  Just signed up like 5 min ago & all I've done so far is talk about myself.
